# **`basemath`**

Instead of continuing to duplicate math functions in every math project I make, why not have a Rust library that I can import at any time?

I am going to make as much math as I can with no dependencies. I'm using generics so that you can use composite mathematical objects with your own types (that is, if you can figure it out with zero documentation).

As you can see, I am very occupied with being bad at programming and hence will not make documentation.
